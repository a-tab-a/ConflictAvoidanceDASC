# Parallel Conflict Avoidance

This directory contains code for the parallel computation of the optimal pairwise encounter conflict avoidance policy using a customized version of DiscreteValueIteration.jl (under the DiscreteValueIteration directory) and [DiscreteMDPs.jl](https://github.com/sisl/DiscreteMDPs.jl). 

The ParSCA.ipynb notebook is provided for the reader's convenience.
